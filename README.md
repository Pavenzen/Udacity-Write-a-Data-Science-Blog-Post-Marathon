# Udacity-Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post-Marathon
This is the repo to Write a Data Science Blog Post project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project about the Boston marathon results

1- Business Understanding

We investigated the Boston Marathon results from 2015,2016 and 2017 to find out what it takes for a 36 year old male to finish it.

For this we need to understand what are the important metrics to finsih the marathon in a certain time. 

For this, we asked 4 questions:

• What is the average time per age group base on the contestens? 
• Which age group has the biggest difference between the 1st and the 2nd half of the marathon?
• Can we somehow predict age or gender by the results after each 5k?
• Can we predict the finish time by the halfway-point time?

2- Data Understanding

The data comes from Kaggel data set Finishers Boston Marathon 2015,2016 & 2017 by the User ROJOUR, the description taken from the Kaggle-page:

Content
It contains the name, age, gender, country, city and state (where available), times at 9 different stages of the race, expected time, finish time and pace, overall place, gender place and division place.
Decided to keep every year as a separate file, making it more manageable and easier to deal with it.

3- Prepare Data

For the data preparation phase, we gathered the data, assessed it and then proceeded to clean it, focusing on our columns of interest, with python libraries of Numpy and Pandas

4- Data Modeling

ongoing

5- Evaluate the Results
Lets see

Finally, the readme format:

the libraries used: probalby Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn but additional might be added down the road.
the motivation for the project: as a upcoming marathon runner in munich on the 19-10-2024 I am alway interested in everything related to marathon runnig, and this data will probably help me set the perfect timetargets to finsih it.
